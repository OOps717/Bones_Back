# Bones Back
This is my first working on the Unity engine with 2D games, while also using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop for working with all graphical stuff as textures, animations and etc.

## Usage
For implemeting the files you need to have Unity engine on your OS. All the libraries are included in each unity project, therefore you need firstly open or create a project.

Read the scripts to better understanding of working of some animations, settings and moves of the character with abilities.

## Release History

* v0.5.0
    * ADD: Main menu, settings, some animations in menu (blood rain in options, button animation and etc.), music on the background, first draft of the character, siple moves
    * Work in progress
